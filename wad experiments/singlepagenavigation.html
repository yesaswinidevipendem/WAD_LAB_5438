        <h4>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable,
             raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped
              in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.</h4><br>

        <h2><a name="history">History of Coffee</a></h2><br>
    <p>  The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the accounts of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen.[2] It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a 
        similar way to how it is prepared now. Coffee was used by Sufi circles to stay awake for their religious rituals.   <br>[13] Accounts differ on the origin of the coffee plant prior to its appearance in Yemen. From Ethiopia, coffee could have been 
        introduced to Yemen via trade across the Red Sea.[14] One account credits Muhammad Ibn Sa'd for bringing the beverage to Aden from the African coast.[15] Other early accounts say Ali ben Omar of the Shadhili Sufi order was the first to introduce coffee to Arabia.[16]
        According to al Shardi, Ali ben Omar may have encountered coffee during his stay with the Adal king Sadadin's companions in 1401. Famous 16th-century Islamic scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami notes in his writings a beverage called qahwa developed from a tree in the Zeila region.[13] <br>
        Coffee was first exported from Ethiopia to Yemen by Somali merchants from Berbera and Zeila in modern-day Somaliland, which was procured from Harar and the Abyssinian interior. <br> According to Captain Haines, who was the colonial administrator of Aden (1839–1854), Mocha
        historically imported up to two-thirds of their coffee from Berbera-based merchants before the coffee trade of Mocha was captured by British-controlled Aden in the 19th century. Thereafter, much of the Ethiopian coffee was exported to Aden via Berbera.
        Coffee contains caffeine. Caffeine works by stimulating the central nervous system (CNS), heart, and muscles. Coffee also contains other chemicals that might have other benefits. Drinking caffeinated coffee can increase the amount of calcium that is flushed out in the <urine class="br"></urine>
        This might weaken bones. If you have osteoporosis, limit caffeine consumption to less than 300 mg per day (less than 3 cups of caffeinated coffee). Taking calcium supplements may help to make up for calcium that is lost. If you are generally healthy and getting enough calcium
        from your food and supplements, taking up to 400 mg of caffeine daily (about 4 cups of coffee) doesn't seem to increase the risk of getting osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women who have an inherited condition that keeps them from processing vitamin D normally, should be especially 
        cautious when using caffeine.</p>
