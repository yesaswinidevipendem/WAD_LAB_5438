        <p> <b><mark>Minions</mark> are fictional yellow creatures that appear in Illumination's Despicable Me franchise.
             They are characterized by their childlike behavior and unique language, which is largely unintelligible.[a]
            The Minions serve as the official mascots for Illumination, and have also been described by The New York Times as "corporate icons"
             for Comcast in the years since their 2013 purchase of Illumination's parent company NBCUniversal; similar to Mickey Mouse for 
             The Walt Disney Company, Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros. Discovery, SpongeBob SquarePants for Paramount Global, or Woody Woodpecker for Universal Studios.
            <mark>Kevin</mark>, <mark>Stuart</mark>, and <mark>Bob</mark> are three of the most familiar minions, who appear as stars in the film Minions (2015). Many other
             Minions are mentioned by name in the films and other media in the franchise. They were created by art director Eric Guillon,
              who worked on several Illumination films. <br>
              In 1968, the three journey to New York City, where they end up in a department store for the night, and accidentally discover a hidden commercial broadcast for
               villains advertising Villain-Con, a convention for all villains and supervillains in Orlando, Florida. The next day they manage to hitchhike a ride with the Nelsons,
                a family of thieves. </b></p>
